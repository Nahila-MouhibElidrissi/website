The most common question that any professional (or even serious amateur) investor receives is:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    <em>What&#8217;s your edge?</em>
  </p>
</blockquote>

Part of having an edge is knowing **exactly** what your personal investment philosophy is. That&#8217;s the purpose of this article &#8211; to explain how I invest and why codifying this process is so important. The outline of this article is listed below along with links in case you&#8217;d like to skip to a particular section.

## The Importance of Having Your Own Investment Philosophy

To begin, let&#8217;s start with the second topic: the importance of having your own personalized investment philosophy, and knowing it inside out. 

Cullen Roche from [Pragmatic Capitalism](https://www.pragcap.com/best-investment-strategy-discipline/) made an excellent analogy related to this by citing [an article on dieting](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/upshot/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-how-to-lose-weight.html) from the New York Times:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    <em>“The bottom line is that the best diet for you is still the one you will stick to. No one knows better than you what that diet might be. You’ll most likely have to figure it out for yourself.”</em>
  </p>
</blockquote>

This is one of many corollaries between health and investing. Both are very similar on paper:

  * **Investing:** diversify, minimize fees, defer taxes, execute for the long-term
  * **Health:** Eat in moderation, exercise frequently (sometimes hard), execute for the long-erm

In investing, the concept of &#8220;the best plan is the one you can stick with&#8221; is very true. Even the most amazing investment strategies go through periods of underperformance. For an example of this, see the magazine article below, which questions the ability of Warren Buffett &#8211; the undisputed best investor of all time:

</div>

This Barron&#8217;s piece was published in 1999 during history&#8217;s most severe technology bubble. When the bubble popped and Buffett&#8217;s sound investment strategy returned to outperformance, media outlets were quick to place him in a positive light once more.

This is all to say that even the best investment strategies go through periods of underperformance. Because of this, any investment system should have the following characteristics (ordered roughly be decreasing importance):

  1. Evidence-Based
  2. Simple
  3. Low Cost
  4. Low Risk

These are all components of my investment strategy, which is explained throughout the remainder of this article.
