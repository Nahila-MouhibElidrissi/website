The first month of the new decade is history, and the results on January 2020 ETF flows are in. Overall, U.S.-listed ETFs gained an additional $51 billion in cash last month. Investors preferred U.S. equity ETFs, placing $17.4 billion in them, with an additional $15.4 billion in fixed income ETFs and $11.9 billion in international ETFs.

Two top issuers, Vanguard and BlackRock, unsurprisingly accounted for the ETFs with the biggest gains. While the absolute numbers are impressive, the percentage of inflows relative to assets under management was not particularly remarkable for many of these ETFs.

The following ETFs had the largest inflows during that period:

## **1. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (**[**VTI**](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VTI)**)**

With equities soaring, it is no surprise that a total stock market ETF from investment giant Vanguard would come out on top. With assets under management of $143 billion in this ETF, inflows for January were $2.7 billion. Vanguard is renowned for its low management expense ratio, and VTI’s is just 0.03 percent – or 3 basis points.

## **2. iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (**[**IEFA**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/244049/IEFA?cid=ppc:ishares_us:google:fund-names-priorities&gclid=CjwKCAiAvonyBRB7EiwAadauqam7psHcGKzC-1PXWm-pRQmykdkzpk7JGm_85O_vx4Qkc5Wp20h0HxoCZyYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)**)**

As its name reveals, this ETF is issued by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset fund manager. With $75 billion in assets under management, inflows in January reached $2.5 billion. This international ETF trades with an expense ratio of 0.07 percent.

## **3. Vanguard Total Market Bond ETF (**[**BND**](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/BND)**)**

Although many bond ETFs saw significant outflows in January, that was not the case with this Vanguard product. With $51 billion in assets under management, BND saw net inflows of $2.1 billion. The management expense ratio is 0.035 percent.

## **4. iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (**[**AGG**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239458/ishares-core-total-us-bond-market-etf)**)**

Another BlackRock offering, this ETF also bucked the January bond ETF trend. With $72 billion in assets under management, AGG saw inflows of $2.1 billion in the year’s initial month. The net expense ratio is 0.05 percent.

## **5. iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (**[**IVV**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239726/IVV?cid=ppc:ishares_us:google:fund-names-priorities&gclid=CjwKCAiAvonyBRB7EiwAadauqSSVpJmSLpptDIaToj-Rwoq1NymarNl46QpR55swHNrH4MoVLzsYvBoCIAMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)**)**

## **7. iShares ESG MSCI U.S.A. ETF (**[**ESGU**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/286007/ishares-esg-msci-usa-etf-fund)**)**

While this BlackRock ETF concentrating on well-rated [environmental, social, and governance (ESG) companies](https://getpassiv.com/blog/primer-esg-investing/) has assets under management of $3.4 billion, its January inflows were an impressive $1.9 billion, or 56 percent of its total market value. Its expense ratio is a relatively high 0.15 percent.
