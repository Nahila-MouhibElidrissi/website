I am a self-taught software engineer and financial analyst that has experience with scaling fast-growing financial technology businesses.

At [Sure Dividend](https://www.suredividend.com/), I built our technology stack from scratch, including Python scripts deployed on AWS EC2 and AWS Lambda, a PostgreSQL relational database on AWS RDS, and a client-facing Wordpress site featuring a members-only login area.

On the software side, the specific technologies I am familiar with are:



*   [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)/[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)/[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
