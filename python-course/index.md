## Slack Community

I want this course to be a personal experience. Because of that, I have created a Slack community for students to ask questions and interact with each other!

For those unfamiliar, Slack is a team messaging platform primarily used by businesses. Think MSN Messenger, but 10x better. I've used Slack in various capacities over the years and have always been pleased with my experience. 

[Click here to sign up for our Slack community and start communicating with other students!](https://join.slack.com/t/nickmccullumscourses/shared_invite/zt-d9bj9yus-rkbkJNaDEEhYCXD8A4zkTw)

## Course Repository

All of the code for this course can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/nicholasmccullum/python-sql-finance). 

The repository is public, which means that you can suggest changes using a pull request later in this course if youâ€™d like. 

## What To Do If You Get Stuck

If you're working through this course and are stuck on a difficult problem, here's what you should do:

* Google for a solution: This is not just me being lazy! Real-world software developers often have to Google for solutions to their problems, so getting practice at this from the start is very beneficial.
* Ask a question in the Slack community: Other students
* Email me: You can use [this link](mailto:nicholasmccullum@gmail.com) to email me. While I always love hearing from students, please exhaust the other two options first since I might not reply right away.

## About Me

My name is Nick McCullum and I have worked in quantitative finance and computer programming for my entire career. I'm currently working as the President of Sure Dividend, where I built our technology stack from scratch, including:

* Python scripts deployed on AWS EC2 and AWS Lambda
* a PostgreSQL relational database on AWS RDS 
* a client-facing Wordpress site featuring a members-only login area

and more.

I created this course because I wanted to make it easy to learn the Python/SQL stack to jump-start your career and live a more fulfilling life.
