The coronavirus pandemic continues to worsen, both in terms of the actual health impact of patients and the broader effect it has had on our economy and psychology. The purpose of this post is to list some real statistics on the coronavirus - **without**the sensationalism that we have seen from some major news outlets.

All of the data presented in this post has been scraped from official U.S. government websites for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In other words, these are the officially reported numbers. The accuracy of this data is influenced primarily by the availability (or lack thereof) of coronavirus tests, and thus may be widely understated. 

This post was last updated on March 22nd, 2020. I intend to update this data as time passes to reflect up-to-date figures.


## Charts

Here are three charts that present the current state of coronavirus in the United States:



Note that the last images excludes 20 states where there have been no coronavirus deaths so far.

## Final Thoughts & Credit Where Credit is Due

The coronavirus pandemic continues to worsen, but I believe the best way for people to stay informed is by reading data - not by reading news. 

Also - this data was provided by the [excellent coronavirus API available here](http://coronavirusapi.com/) and created by Danny Yang and Susan Joseph. A prime motivation in writing this blog post (aside from spreading accurate data about coronavirus statistics) was to raise awareness and funds for their project. 

The project is accepting contributions through all of the major cryptocurrencies. If you have cryptocurrency to spare, please consider donating to their project.
